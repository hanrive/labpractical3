# What is ArcGIS Enterprise?

* "ArcGIS Enterprise is the foundational software system for GIS, powering mapping and visualization, analytics, and data management. It is the backbone for running the Esri suite of applications and your own custom applications... Collaboration and flexibility are central to ArcGIS Enterprise, allowing you to organize and share your work on any device, anywhere, at any time. ArcGIS Enterprise gives you complete control over your deployment." *

# What is ArcGIS Server?

* "ArcGIS Server is the software that powers all 2D data and spatial capabilities in Esri's web-based products. At the core, ArcGIS Server creates and shares map services, which are made available through a URL using a REST interface (aka endpoint).  ArcGIS Server used to be a stand-alone and complete product, but in 2016 Esri split it up and requires separate licenses for publishing functionality in Server, like image (raster) services for sharing aerial imagery." *

- API = Application Programming Interface
- Allows two systems to communicate with one another

  > Alright, imagine you have a magical toy box, and you're a child who wants to play with your toys. But instead of reaching inside the box yourself, you have a friend, let's call them Mr. API, who can get the toys for you.
  >
  > Now, Mr. API works like a magical messenger between you and the toy box. You tell Mr. API what toy you want to play with, and he goes to the toy box, gets it for you, and brings it back. You don't need to worry about how he gets it; you just need to ask.
  > 
  > In this way, an API (which stands for "Application Programming Interface") is like a friendly helper that lets different computer programs talk to each other and share information. It's like a special language they use to communicate and exchange data, just like you and Mr. API communicate to get your toys. So, you can think of an API as a way for different programs to work together and share what they have, just like friends sharing toys from a toy box.

- API are categorized as either SOAP or REST and both are used to access web services
  - SOAP relies solely on XML to provide messaging services while REST offers a more lightweight method usingURLs in most cases to receive or send information
  - REST uses four different HTTP 1.1 verbs to perform tasks: ** GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE **
- An API Endpoint is one end of a communication channel as in when an API interacts with another system the touchpoints of this communication are considered endpoints
  - These are important because they ensure that each touchpoint in API communication is intact in transferring vital information, processes, transactions, and more (API performance relies on its ability to communicate effectively with API Endpoints)
